## Hey there,

I'm William, a Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore (NUS) specializing in Software Engineering and full-stack systems development.

• 🧠 Founder of Aqua Vitae Parfums, where I engineered and deployed a production-grade React frontend integrated with a Shopify backend for secure global checkout.

• ⚙️ Developed PeerPrep, a microservices-based MERN platform supporting scalable coding interview workflows with independent backend services and distributed architecture.

• 🧩 Built multiple full-stack applications using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, focusing on modular architecture, scalability, and clean system design.

• 🚀 Deployed production applications using Vercel, MongoDB Atlas, and modern CI/CD pipelines.

• 🎓 Previously deployed a production website for a client with custom domain infrastructure, DNS routing, and analytics integration.
